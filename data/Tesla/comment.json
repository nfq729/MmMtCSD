Our camera system on the vehicle has recorded the whole process. We have already filed a report to the local police department. Based on the grocery this man purchased, he likely lives in the area around that Costco. For people doing things like this for no reason, or maybe just for fun, if we don't hold them accountable, he might think it's okay, not a big deal, and next time, your car may get keyed for no reason. So please help us find this guy and hold him accountable. If you recognize this person in the video, please call the Sunnyvale Police Department at 408-730-7100. Thank you so much!

I'm pretty sure the car slowed down by itself because I wouldn't be choosing to slow down in the middle of an intersection (so if it wasn't me, it must've been the car slowing down itself). Out of my peripherals, for a split second, I saw something on the right side and before I could even react, I heard the beeping and pressed on the brake. I'm not sure if the car was braking before I started braking, but at the same time I think my reaction would've been too slow if it were me doing all the braking, which is why I think the car did some of the braking.  Too bad the dashcam doesn't have access to the B-Pillar cameras. I'm pretty sure that's the camera that saw the car coming. In the dashcam footage tesla provides, obviously the angle isn't the greatest and only see the car for a few frames.

Not everyone is eligible for the tax credit, so there might be a an uplift on model 3 residuals from people buying used to get ‘access’ to the incentive."

    "bady": "As someone who used to work in the car dealership industry, I would almost never recommend leasing.  Sure,  the payment is slightly less but you're constrained by mileage and left with no asset at the end of your term.  The only scenario where it makes a little sense (though I'd still suggest buying outright) is if you want an imported luxury that is expensive to repair (BMW, Jaguar, Audi, etc.) and you know you're going to want a new one every few years anyway. That's just about the only time it kinda makes sense.  Edit: Let's do some math, shall we?  Total cost of leases are pretty easy to calculate. I went to Tesla's website and found a vehicle for the same price as the one OP is considering. For three years lease, it would cost $19.5k for 10k miles per year, $20.2k for 12k miles per year, or about $21k for 15k miles per year.  To own that car for three years would cost about $22k ($39k loan, 6% interest). That assumes you are not paying it off early and making minimum payments with one exception: I factored in the $7.5k as a lump payment. You would still owe about $14k on the vehicle.   So, using the $19.5k lease cost and the $22k purchase cost, as long as the vehicle is worth more than $16.5k at the end of the three years, it would make sense to buy it even if you intended to sell it in three years. Anything it's worth beyond that is extra value that you can apply to your next vehicle."

They tend to say the dumbest shit ever that customers /always/ negatively respond to because a technician has no clue how to talk to a customer. It's best to just take that aspect out aswell. Not that anything is inherently wrong with how a tech is, it's kind of just the nature of the type of person that works on cars. Good or bad.

You just link a debit or credit card to your account and if you're at a Tesla Supercharger you can charge there.  The best thing to do is look on like plugshare which is an app to see if there's places closest to you and there is probably some like free ones too. My area has free DC fast charging so it will get like 50 to 60 kilowatts an hour which is even faster than a level 2 charger. But you would need to buy the adapter from Tesla so that you can use the non Tesla DC fast charging because I don't know of any Tesla Supercharger that has free charging. Also it would be wise to get a charger put in at home that's a level 2 charger. You can get a $1,500 for having one installed too. You basically send me in your invoice showing that you had that installed. If you do end up getting a used charger that doesn't qualify you for the rebate but you can submit your electrical work and have that count towards it.  Also check with your local power company and see if they have a special rate plan for having an electric vehicle. For me I have a special rate plan for my whole house and during off-peak which is between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. it's only like 5 cents a kilowatt. Between 9:00 to 11:00 it's on Peak which is 25 cents a kilowatt then 11:00 to 3:00 it's off peak which is 5 cents a kilowatt then from 3:00 to 8:00 it's on Peak again at 25 cents a kilowatt.

[The story appeared on Walla website]\r   \r   This is not how C, a resident of Kibbutz Mefalsim, planned to spend last Shabbat. But minutes after the Hamas forces invaded the settlements outside Gaza, C, a member of the settlement's emergency squad, was called to an incident. He rushed to his Tesla Model 3 Performance and started driving to the assembly point. His Apple Watch was stopped by a shrapnel at 6:50.\r   \r   Photos that appeared for the first time on the Tesla Israel Telegram channel document what happened next. Speaking from Sheba Hospital where he is hospitalized after a series of head and hand surgeries, he spoke about a drive he will never forget.\r   \r   \"The terrorists recognized me from a distance of 10 yards. In addition to their Kalashnikovs, they had a machine gun that fired bullets of a larger caliber. They did not realize that it was an EV, so they shot at the front, hoping to hit the engine that wasn't there, and at the back, trying to set the fuel tank on fire. Of course there was also no fuel tank. They shot my tires. I pressed the accelerator, and they started chasing me.\"\r   \r   In this battle it was a Toyota truck against one driver in a private car. But it was also a chase between a diesel truck with about 150 hp, against an electric sedan with more than 530 hp and dual drive. About 15 well-armed terrorists facing a wounded, but determined driver, who found himself fighting for his life hundreds of meters from his home.\r   \r   \"They shot my tires, but the acceleration of the Tesla is amazing even in this situation, and the dual drive managed to keep me on the road. I quickly got away from them, but I realized that I had to get to the hospital as soon as possible and I drove at a speed of 112 mph with flat tires. The tires started to crumble, but the dual drive balanced out the wheels, some of which were already on the rims. According to the app, I continued to drive at around 110 mph.\"\r   \r   C had already made the journey from Barzilai Hospital in Ashkelon in an ambulance, after the bullet-riddled Tesla managed to bring him to the hospital gates. Although about 100 bullet holes were counted in the car, the front window remained cracked all the way but did not disintegrate. The windows of the doors were smashed by the rescue teams who rushed to get him out and transfer him to treatment.\r   \r   \"Bullets hit my legs and hand, got one in the skull and I was also hit by shrapnel. But my head works, and motivation kept me on the road and even now in the hospital. The car continued to drive, the battery didn't heat up, but it took a lot of damage. There is no part that didn't take a bullet. It still drives if you press the pedal, but it seems to me that I should already be thinking about my next Tesla.\""

So I don't think the headlights will be matrix, the stalks will be gone, cheaper interior materials, cheaper taillights, no sensors etc. etc. They need to get the price to sub 35 so 20's after rebates. Anyone who thinks this car is going to be better than the current Model 3 are barking up the wrong tree."

It had USS and a backup camera.  The camera sucked and USS, well it was useless at the tolerances we were dealing with, just beeping nonstop.  Solution was to again roll down the windows and take it slow, occasionally getting out of the car.  Eventually this became easier as we learned the right angles to turn at.

When you fill up gas you make selections, swipe the card, pump the gas, hang it up, get the receipt. You're standing there the whole time. Whatever time that takes, you're actively standing there waiting on.  When I got to the SC right there I took 10 seconds to insert the cord, and did whatever I wanted, some if it I might want to do anyway. Stretch my legs, check my phone, go into a store, etc.  Now lets say we both had to pee and grab a drink.  You stood by your car for 4 minutes, then moved it to a parking spot, then went in and peed and got a coffee.  I was done interacting with my car in 10 seconds, went in to pee, went in to get a drink, and that whole time my car was charging.  Pulled in at the same time, and we left at the same time. Who \"waited\" more in either situation there? Gas guy did. Sure, he left with enough gas for a week, and I may have only got enough charge to get to my garage, but that's not a knock on the EV, that's the whole point.  Even for people who do ALL their charging on SCs, so they need longer, fuller charges. Like 45 minutes+ here and there or 20 minutes at lunch most every day. If they just get that while they're eating, how long did they \"wait\"? People need to eat. People like to go out to eat. Some every day. Sure it might direct/limit WHERE they eat, but still the \"charging\" part of that took like 30 seconds all in. \"Go get gas\" guy didn't have his card swiped in the time it takes to actually plug and unplug the SC."

Even back then, when it was a ton of v2s (maybe even before most went to 150), we got like 10 minutes into one episode. We just weren't sitting there that long.  Nowadays there's a shit load of v3s on the route. They make it charge so fast that they've started to prioritize \"right on the highway\" over \"have something to do\", which helps doubley speed things up.  The last time we took the trip there was like one time we waited on the car. MOST of the time we overcharged what we needed to get to the next one.

    "bady": "Exactly.  And the hard truth is that if you’re that concerned about the difference in monthly payment of a couple hundred dollars, perhaps you (generally speaking) cannot really afford such an expensive car.  That $20K or so would be much better purposed in an emergency or rainy day fund for life’s unexpected mishaps.  Or accelerating the payoff of your highest interest debts.  Not to mention retirement and college savings.  Health insurance, life insurance, etc.  Keeping the cash liquid gives you flexibility to strategically prioritize certain debts to save on interest, capitalize on emerging opportunities, invest for yourself, and provides a cushion in case of illness, layoff, major repair, pandemic shutdown, etc.  It’s admirable to want to pay off your debts aggressively.  But it’s smarter to pay a little interest and plan / be prepared for an unpredictable future.  Now, obviously, credit cards which typically charge 1% interest or more, per month, need to be paid off immediately.  Unless you keep your cars for 6-10 years or more, you’ll almost always have a car payment.  It’s really more of an experience.  Cars are rarely / almost never an investment.  Right now the used car market is a bit out of whack, but usually used cars depreciate like a stone."

    "bady": "Because of inflation, your dollars are worth more now than they ever will be in the future. Do you want to give up those valuable dollars now? Or would you rather pay a much smaller amount over the next several years as you keep bringing in money from work and investments?  \"I don't want to pay you a little more over the next 6 years, so I'm going to give you all of that money now\" doesn't seem wise to me.. It wouldn't make sense to hang on to the down payment money if you're just going to blow it on worthless stuff but you have the option to just not do that.  Shortly after I bought my first new car, I got a better paying job and would make double or triple the payments because I wanted the car paid off early. This was in 2015, 2016. If I would have thrown that extra cash into a few different stocks/etfs every month, I'd have a lot more money today.

Now, they want a feature to keep their car on if a ~10 pound person or animal is left in the vehicle on accident, taking the blame off the parents/owners and onto the vehicle. That's just dumb when there are already features in place to work as this person wanted them to, which is knowingly leaving living things in a vehicle."

I was at a brunch restaurant a couple of years ago and three Mom's had toddler aged kids with them and the Mom's wanted to talk/dribnk mimosas in pead so to placate the kids, each one had a tablet. They all looked like those little Pod People form the dark crystal when their souls are being drained for life juice by the skeksis. Anyway, half way through brunch, one of the tablets dies and the kid throws a nuclear shit fit, screaming due ot the fact they no longer have a computer to mindlessly entertain them.  Mom grabs a magazine from her bag and gives it to her kid.  After 30 seconds, the kid tries to \"swipe\" the magazine page with one finger. Tries again and the image doesn't change.

    "bady": "The fact that gen alpha kids will be lose the ability to know how to operate an analog clock, and therfore are competent clueless about all the terminology related to anolog clocks (clockwise & anticlockwise, bottom of the hour & top of the hour, number in relation to spacial awareness like \"9 o'lock, your 6, etc) is truly sad. Like I said, I'm gen z and even a lot of us don't know that terminology. When looking at a clock turns from a complex integrated system where everything on the dial has meaning turns into \"just look at the time and read it\", you know that's already beginning the downfall of our mental capacity of outward thinking. Even military time, some people have trouble with even that because they gotta mentally subtract 12 passed noon...  It's truly depressing and I'm really hoping we intentionally revert our lives back to maintain our mental sharpness and depth to life. That's one of my fears with electric cars being for Ed to completely replace gas cars. They still have stiff going on, but most of it is ones and zeros which require computers to program, and not physical things having a cascade reaction on other things. From a practical sense, that's more practical in most cases and are cheaper to run for now (while electricity is cheap), but learning how complex things interact with eachother is so much deeper than just engine ignites fuel and moves cat, its engine ignites intakes air, ignites fuel and air, comp pushes piston which pushes crank which drives valves which opens pathways for air/fuel and exhaust etc. Learning how those things work is so much more valuable than just knowing how an engine works, it improves spacial logic and how things interact with other things. Same thing with cameras and sensors becoming mandatory on cars. You loose that requirement for Spacial awareness, which will enviably make us dumber and more reliant on technology.   And that's just the complex aspect of how we learn, then there's the topic I brought up before of how our minds are adapting to simple and basic \"click = reward\" systems, which literally leads to the downfall of our society after every following generation. It's truly depressing. I would consider myself pretty \"skilled\" by most gen z terms.

If they leave their car in 100F+ Arizona heat for a couple of days, and it keeps thinking there is someone in the back seat when there is not, then the car will try to air condition the car down to a nice human temperature (say 70F), not the 90+ that cabin overheat protection will try (and only for the 12 hours as you stated).

They were already in the next state driving someone else’s suburban. They had gotten to street where he was parked, unlocked a completely different suburban (not sure of fob too or just key) loaded it up and drove off without a clue."

When we bought our 3 it was like here’s the car please sign here and you can go. I hope you get your issues resolved. I will say that they are really fun cars and I do enjoy ours. If you can get past the little quirks or get it working to your satisfaction. Every car I’ve ever owned had its own issues so I am now comforted by the thought that no car will be prefect."

    "bady": "Actually, there was a huge backlash against automobiles (and even electricity) back in the day. Some places enacted laws that made it impossible or impracticable to drive through them. Vermont passed a law requiring a person to walk in front of the car waving a red flag, which rather defeated the purpose of using the car in the first place. In Glencoe, Illinois, someone stretched a length of steel cable across a road in an effort to stop “the devil wagons.” Some cities banned automobiles outright.  In Pennsylvania, a group calling itself the Farmers’ Anti-Automobile Society of Pennsylvania proposed the following not-so-subtle additions to state law:   1. Automobiles traveling on country roads at night must send up a rocket every mile, then wait ten minutes for the road to clear. The driver may then proceed, with caution, blowing his horn and shooting off Roman candles, as before.   2. If the driver of an automobile sees a team of horses approaching, he is to stop, pulling over to one side of the road, and cover his machine with a blanket or dust cover which is painted or colored to blend into the scenery, and thus render the machine less noticeable.   3. In case a horse is unwilling to pass an automobile on the road, the driver of the car must take the machine apart as rapidly as possible and conceal the parts in the bushes.  The same ridiculous \"fear of change\" or anything that challenges the status quo is driving backlash against EVs. Especially Teslas, as they are easily recognizable. I think most Tesla owners are familiar with pickup trucks \"rolling coal\" at them, blocking or vandalizing charging stations, or parking so close they block the doors. There is also a general hatred of Elon Musk especially since he took over Twitter that may contribute to this.   I shadow a number of EV owner forums, and I haven't seen or heard of similar vandalism being taken against the F150 Lightening, the Mach-E, VW iD4, or other brands - although some non-Tesla charging stations are being ICE'd or outright vandalized.

He has certainly done more for environmentalism than they ever have. Also it's important to realize just how much straight up fabricated information (emerald mine) and accusations about him there are out there. Really hard to see what's true and what's true, but (intentionally or not) missing a key piece of contextual information or things that are just straight up made up. It's really crazy to me that people go after him in particular when the media dug up as much shit as they could find on him when he said he would support Republicans a while back and all they could find was that several years ago he may or may not have flashed a flight attendant (intentionally or unintentionally) during a spa treatment. Like, what??? If that's the worst thing that he's done that immediately makes him better than 99% billionaires and 90% of all politicians. He is without a doubt the best billionaire in terms of character, go shit on Jeff bezos he's the real douchebag.  Additonally, I'd like to remind all of you that he, and spacex, donated $200 million to st judge's children's hospital with the inspiration 4 mission. The first mission to send humans past the orbit of the hubble space telescope since the cancelation of Apollo. This was ignored by the biden administration, and democrats at large, who do often make proud comments about American space travel (and now every time I see them do that all I can see is how hypocritical and slimy they are).  He also paid more in taxes to the United states than any single person in history (over $11 billion last year). That also is another massive point on why he is the best billionaire in my opinion, and this is also largely ignored.  Look, I know he's been a jerk to a few people, but so has everyone we see on the news ever.

Nobody likes being recorded, the car is basically flipping the bird  at people as they walk by, and they’re answering."

However, be that the ‘bu is a non-visitor friendly place, its not that city you should aim your anger to- its the Tesla Delivery Center.  The law in california clearly requires plates installed and  displayed correctly and properly (if you are issued a front and back, you must install both); and as you said so yourself, the center instead of installing the front plate abeit temporary, they did not, they placed it at the dash.  Your friend should have told the center to install the front plate properly. Its the law. There is also a reason why front plates matter especially with Teslas being a common sight: To differentiate or identify the vehicle assuming there are traffic incidents or even toll roads requirements.  But lets be honest too— your friend does not want the front plate. Hey if he/she doesn’t want it, contact your representative to have that requirement removed. Have that law removed.  "

Usually you’ll see a 200-500$ increase in msrp for the new model.. you don’t see a 10k increase one month and then a 3k decrease the next week, followed by a 2k decease, followed by another 3k decrease.

    "bady": "Yes I believe that’s how it works. If you go on Tesla website now and click through to purchase a vehicle and put down the non refundable $250 or whatever, you are locked at that price. Should it drop again before you receive it, they have zero obligation to change your price lower, and they won’t.  I’d like to know if someone is able to walk away pre delivery at any time and only lose the $250.   I can’t remember how I did my first 3 in 2018 I think it was. I think I made the payment/transfer the day I took delivery at the dealer. And with the demo X i got lucky and bought it same day I saw it at the dealer and drove home. In fact I recall now that Tesla did their first ever price drop on model 3 the very evening I picked mine up and I wish I had thought of this then. Though I think it would’ve taken several more months to get another at that time as these were launch orders. All fuzzy memory now.  Today, if you haven’t paid anything more than the $250, and are willing to wait 4-6 weeks (or less) to get that $3k discount (and why wouldn’t you!), I’d walk in a heartbeat.

Called roadside and downloaded the app and logged in on a strangers phone (a 55 year old semi driver in the Midwest, imagine trying to explain what’s going on to him.  Great guy actually).  No one could get it unlocked, but the windows would vent.  Managed to get in the car but couldn’t do anything and couldn’t find the keys anywhere.  Couldn’t roll the windows up…I was about 75 miles from home, wife had to come get me and she’s pissed.    Wife drove me right back to the SC when they opened in the morning (Saturday morning-175 miles she was pleased :) ) but keys were no where to be found.  The same advisor was there too, they even had the maintenance guy go through the trash in the dumpster.  Manager strolls in an hour later and I finally get through to him what the issue was after about 30 minutes. He was able to call an engineer to remote flash the car to allow mobile access.  I was able to drive home from the app.  They sent a ranger to give me new keys the next week.

Few questions,   First, did YOU see the chaos up ahead and decide to just let it run its course and see what AP would do, or were you blind (or inattentive) as well?  Second, in your professional opinion as a human who holds a drivers license, do you think that swerving was the right move? Do you think that you had enough braking distance to slam on the brakes instead?  I’ve noticed that FSD seems to prefer charging ahead and maintaining speed, it never seems to want to emergency brake.   In any case, extremely impressive if that was without human input."

Mercedes on the other hand - safety recall for airbags, a few dozen deaths as a result of the fault. What was it 2017/2018 that they got their wrists slapped on that.

Went up that evening, saw that my car still looked worse than when I had originally brought it in and let them know that the work was not complete. They said I could keep the loaner and they'll take care of my car the next day.  Two days go by and my car hasn't moved, so I asked for a status update. \"Your car is ready\". Really that's odd, how long has it been ready for?  \"The work was finished at 11:30 on Tuesday.\" Holy shit did I let it rip. I thought I hated dealerships. \"Service Centers\" are sooo much worse. My car is still fucked up from when they \"fixed\" it before."

Tips:  Move the Energy Graph app to the bottom dock and consult it every half hour while driving to see if you are on track. If you fall below the target 10%, drive slower or stop at an earlier supercharger.  With more experience, you'll be comfortable pulling in with a single digit percentage.  Driving into LA, with tons of chargers, going low and not paying attention is fine. But if the next charger is 100 miles ahead and you predict 4%, then watch closely.  The car will also notify you if it gets too close to 0%  Last tip:  Try ABRP,  abetterrouteplanner.com for more options than Tesla has. You can play with minimal charge at arrival."

Consider this situation: you're on the highway just getting the top of a hill and you see that the traffic has come to a stop below in front of you. You have time to gradually slow down, but you know that cars behind you don't see the traffic yet. What do you do?

Rattles are normal when the car is so silent, i had a couple, quick fix for the mobile ranger, not the car is nice and quiet, but indeed it was a problem.  As for the missing structural bolts and roofs flying off, as you said, this things shouldn't happen and the criticism is well deserved, but i would add that the roof flying off was a 1 out of 1 million cars, shouldn't happen, but when you mass produce, something like this will happen, and has happened to any manufacturer, same with the structural bolts missing, fortunately we have seen just a couple cases and no one got hurt.

It was fascinating to everybody that a $50k car was beat on in this fashion, but it was absolutely necessary.  Some people here argue as to whether or not this type of body scrutiny is needed, but it does serve a purpose beyond looks. Take the doors for example. They are hung by hinges attached to the side posts, and if they are slightly angled differently then the closing force on the door can be too great. This means a light push of the door to close it won't be enough, the door may only halfway latch. The door striker placement also determines seal to body distance, which prevents leaks and wind noise. The deck lid striker placement dictates electric assist closing force and longevity of the latch assembly. Panel to panel flushness decreases wind noise and changes appearance of body lines blending together.  We really did beat on the cars. If the left rear door was sticking out at the top and the bottom was too close to the side panel, we would open the door, put a knee against the lower door panel, both hands across the top of the window frame, and yank backwards with your body weight.

I thought one of the compelling design decisions made in designing the various Teslas was that the computing and software was more centralized. Instead of every component having its own interface and chip, often sold by various manufacturers, Tesla was able to centralize much of this with the interface presented on the touch screen and the control logic handled in the main software that is updated OTA. Obviously some chips are needed for localized control of things like the airbags, which Elon once mentioned as a supply chain bottleneck at one point. But do Teslas really have more chips than ICE cars?"

The rest are CCS1, mainly, and even if you have an adapter (which you can buy, though it’s hard) the CCS1 chargers tend to be broken or slow fairly often, while Tesla’s chargers are reliably fast and are broken much less often.

In Europe Tesla might have the biggest Europe wide network, but due to international roaming the country wide networks in modern states are so awesome and reliable (except Italy) that you are often cheaper by using them although they are also as reliable and as fast as superchargers.  It would be dumb to pay 58ct/kWh in Germany at a supercharger if I can just pay 45ct/kWh on any other HPC.   In the US that simply doesn't work. Tesla nearly has a monopoly if they'd open the network to everyone. And for Tesla cars Tesla right now has a monopoly.

EVERYBODY who switches insurance companies is saving money at the new company.  Insurance companies assess risk differently, and anyone can generally save money by shopping around.  Plenty could have found a good rate just by trying more companies.  Then, insurance companies have an incentive to convince you to let them spy on you.  So of course the intro rate for a data vacuum policy is sweetened.  Then they can slowly cook you over time.  By the time you realize it, it's too late.  The system has your info.

It's a marketing tool for them, they show it to potential customers and try to convince them to pay for consulting.  Apple is on the list because those potential customers are worried about whatever Apple is doing. Of I had to guess, I'd say that the customers Guidehouse is targeting to sell to are the \"contenders\" the companies that feel like they're falling behind, but might be convinced to pay a consultant to help catch up.

    "bady": "Bugatti hasn’t even attempted top speed in their car yet. The 261 is just what they limit the car to right now for their customers.  Everyone knows it will be 280mph+, the question is can they find new tires that let them reach 300.  If you read Motor Trend’s review of the Chiron, they said a $180k Turbo S would accelerate as fast in 0-60, but the Chiron feels to accelerate faster from 60-180mph than it does 0-60, that’s where most of the power delivery is.  It’s odd that Tesla only bragged about 0-60 and 0-100mph numbers, for most hyper cars that aim for 250mph+ top speed, they brag about 0-124, 60-150, or 0-200mph time, that’s where the differences lie.   Actually they mostly brag about lap times around the Nurburgring, since that’s a better indicator of the overall performance of a vehicle.    One big concern with EV in this context is that due to the nature of EV, a powerful car would require a big battery pack, and current battery technology means it will be a very heavy battery pack. Weight is public enemy number one as far as motor sport engineering is concerned, so the Roadster's track performance is still a big question mark at this point. I personally think if they solve the battery cooling issue, it should be very respectable, but very, very unlikely to be record setting considering some of the [bat shit insane stuff] that's coming out right around the same time.  Fun fact: right now there is a [pissing match between Bugatti and Koenigsegg], would love to see the new Roadster jumping into the foray.   Edit: Don’t get me wrong, I love, *love* the new Roadster, and it's super cool that now an electric car will likely be the king of drag races.

Thank you for writing this comment. I saw this post and felt it was really just not telling the full story about the differences between the Chiron and the roadster.   We also don't know how the Roadster is going to handle and ride and feel at those speeds. One of the hallmarks of the Veyron was it's *incredible* stability. Other cars could do 230 or 250, but they'll be bumping and jumping and tough to keep on the straight and narrow - and you wouldn't expect a lot of luxury inside.

It still brakes hard in cases where a blind person could see it coming and it still doesn't accelerate to keep with the car in front well but hey.

The S is more descent, but way too expensive for what’s offered. If I were buying an $80k+ car, there are a number things I would expect from the car and the manufacturer.   Tesla is a tech company that needs to learn how to consistently produce a quality car. I’m glad they’re setting the standard for electric car ranges and efficiency, but I’m more excited for the real players to start transitioning their cars because that’s what I’ll be looking to buy."

Combining both, sounds good. And theoretically the solar tiles should last longer than a high quality asphalt roof, so, savings!  Then no communications other than we are scheduling it for a year. Finally they come back letting me know it would cost $95k."

Tesla is pretty only collecting camera data, and they still have made a huge investment in labeling, with custom software and probably a lot of hardware thrown at autolabeling. Even with all this human labeling is very important, with autolabeling acting to make people more efficient as opposed to replacing them.  Now, what if Tesla had been using lidar? Not only would they have to collect all that data, but they'd have to label it all too. The more info you want to extract from a dataset, the more carefully you have to label it, and the more problems that mistakes can make. I remember hearing comments from people at Tesla about how small mistakes in human labeling can cause big issues down the line with training. I can only imagine what kinds of small mistakes can sneak in when you have people trying to label lidar point clouds, again, the more detail you want to get out of them, the more labeling you need to put in.  And I'd suspect radar is even more difficult for people to label, just because it's not a data source that's easy to translate in to a human readable format. But, if you have your vision autolabeling and/or lidar autolabeling running really well, this makes labeling other kinds of data much easier. You can use the video, which is very easy for people to label (and very easy to catch mistakes on) and use that as tool to make the other datasets easier to label. I'm sure they'll still need a lot of human input, especially initially, but over time I can see a vision + radar autolabeler getting good enough for it to be efficient to label the amount of data Tesla is generating.

But yeah, it's a super weird design with the fat rearend & a tall skinny cabin.  Tesla has really dropped the ball on car design imo. They looked cool when they first became mainstream, but it's so stale now. Other EV manufacturers at least have decided to make the front grill look somewhat interesting.  I really can't wait to see a Cybertruck in the wild. I was at Lowe's the other day & looked up to see what I thought was a F-150 in the parking lot until I saw \"Lightning\" on the back quarter panel & I chuckled thinking about some contractor loading up a Cybertruck with lumber or bags of concrete."

Toyota barely missed the most sales of a single model with the Carolla and if you add up all Toyota sales, IN THE US ALONE, they still sold 11% more than Tesla did wordlwide.   Worldwide, Toyota sold 454% more cars than Tesla in the 1st quarter alone and that's one automaker. Tesla is a NICHE player in the auto market. Right now, there's demand for EV's and Tesla can fill the demand. As other automakers meet demand, it's going to get harder for Tesla to remain relevant.

Speakers rattles with bass-y songs and front pillar speaker pops and cracks at random times with music and no music."

Insurance is incredibly expensive $2600 for 2 drivers clean record (10 years each) good credit, 12 months. But, the gas savings i got in both was over $2,000/mo thanks to California gas prices being absurd.

You don’t get to the stage of mass production and realise you’ve got a huge fundamental flaw in your production process, after investing millions in tooling and have to rethink.  It’s the whole point of prototypes, not just to create proof of concept but to also look at how production and quality can be improved for when you go into mass production."

    "bady": "I use assist drive all the time. Here's what I've learned over 2 or so years using it daily.  - don't use on sharp turns, including u turns, or exit/on ramps. The vehicle might think, hey 25mph is fine because of the speed limit, when you really need to slow down more.  - don't use in construction zones. It usually yells at you anyways when it sees traffic cones and such, but just don't take the chance. It might get confused with intersecting lines, lack of shoulders, etc.  - if you pass a section of road where the left lane expands for a turn lane, or where the lines temporarily disappear, your car might yank you into that zone unexpectedly. I would say it's happened to me 10 times ever, but one time almost rammed me into the side of a bridge out of nowhere. Scared the crap out of me, but solidified my distrust in the system.   Drive assist should not be trusted. In my opinion it makes long highway drives very nice, but be wary anywhere else. Hope this helps."

I don't have an issue with either, as long as customers are getting a good experience. Ford and GM are trying to move towards having a hybrid of the two, which I think is ultimately the right move  Franchised car dealerships are incentivized to provide good service because that's where they make $$$. It works in the automaker's favor because the cost of inventory and setting up shop is on the dealership.

Brakes on other EVs are rarely an issue, and can last a very long time.  Other EVs go through tires about the same rate. They're fully consumable items.   Wipers are purely dependent on use need."

Elon has frequently claimed that Teslas are the only cars that get better over time, and so it's not surprising that people are upset when the opposite turns out to be true.  Examples: 1) Radar being disabled and max AP speed being reduced from 90 to 85 2) USS absent from new Teslas - will they be disabled on older Teslas too? 3) Stalks and center horn gone on S/X and soon also on Model 3 refresh. Non-ergonomic yoke.  I'm not saying there haven't been improvements too, but I'd just prefer that we get more improvements and avoid the unhelpful regressions that no customer asked for.

And I have been figuring out where it works well, and if you do a 3x3 matrix of infrastructure complexity and scene complexity, they could fairly convincingly talk about it working on empty 90-degree streets....or empty streets with whatever complexity...it's the number of actors as the infrastructure gets more complex where it has issues = San Francisco hills with skaters, stop signs that people don't stop at bikers etc...then it becomes unusable...  There are also use cases like long city streets with a lot of traffic and traffic lights – there it works well too.  Where it absolutely doesn't work consistently are intersections and stop signs...so as a heavy user of FSD I thought of my job as understanding the limits of the system so I can use it responsibly. I usually test the edge cases I am unsure about when I drive alone. Same thing with (Navigate on) Autopilot...I use it and trust it not to do stupid things between SF and SJ and I genuinely do that drive because of business much more willingly than I would without it.  e.g. the level 3 Merc assist now that is certified, is a use case I use every day and don't need to worry...the problem of this system is all marketing and it is an insult to the work of the engineers who work on it...if it was marketed more cautiously and slowly chipped away at confident scenarios, it would have been much better. ..  I got really angry in September when we got it and saw how bad it really is...happiness = expectations - reality...Elon is fucking up the expectations and therefore trust of his customer....I have since become way more stoic about it and it has a real utility in my life now"

We just did wheel bearings on a 2010 Nissan for about $1,200, and over time it has probably had other kinds of maintenance done, with more work on the way.  All technology has parts that fail. It's the nature of the tech that decides how much, where, and when, and if the cost of servicing and fueling collectively balanced out, then it would make sense to consider an electric.

Instead of claiming \"humans use only vision to drive\" (we really do not) and ignoring any data suggesting better options for the tech. Hardly a scientific/technologically minded attitude.  On a lark, I still let the FSD beta try do city roads every so often. Nope, still far from ready.  Yup. Still get the same phantom braking, bridge shadows included."

A colleagues Model 3 invoice looks like this:   - Model 3 base price <– amount of money to get the subsidies - Front Motor AWD <- the Delta from Base to your actual Model  - Colour of the Interior <- if chosen  - Deliver and Final Inspection Fee <- hahaha - Autopilot, Colour of the Car, Premium Interior itself, Access to Supercharger, Rims (not tires!) on the car, Standard Connectiviy, Direct Delivery Cost with not cost attached.   The last time I got a invoice for a new car, the invoice position table filled out two pages with details from footmats, to USS, to the kind of speakers used to the tries on it, not just the rims. Tesla wants to have as little papertrail as possible, to make \"OTA\" changes like this - and deny even maybe more later.   I guess the radar cars had nothing on their invoice pointing at radar itself, too. BUT at the period of order, the USS, like radar, where advertised on their page.   With that, Tesla will try to get away with delivering cars without USS, to folks that ordered a few months ago where it was still adverised at the time of the order.

    "bady": ">er.  After all a human using their vision can do a better job than either the parking sensors or rain sensors.  It's just been released very prematurely whilst the solution is in its infancy.  Having a static, monoscopic camera system is just not close to being an analog for human vision and spatial awareness.   They've taken an arguably pointlessly challenging approach, and added a difficulty multiplier on top.    DNNs can't adapt;    Unless you can make the world unchanging, you're just not going to reach the finish line.   To quote [Stfanos Tsimenidis]:   \"In such a system no amount of training data will be adequate as it would only   broaden the range of interpolation.    An infinite problem space can not be   approximated by the finite subspace of training instances, and this is true even in the era of big data.\"  I don't think anyone is saying that USS did everything perfectly; they have a task that they perform well, and then one should fill the gaps with other sensors.   The cost of a set of USSs are not going to move the dial to any meaningful degree in a car costing 5 digits, especially the mid 5's. Even the cheapest cars on the market have them, they are cheap.     Even if they manage to perfectly replicate a human's ability to identify arbitrary objects and gauge its distance via vision alone, it's still going to have weaknesses that either USS and/or a human driver would not have.  An example is low visibility, be it darkness, bright light, weather or debris.   Something as simple as dirt; Last winter my reverse camera was constantly caked in salt and road dirt from slush, same with the side cams when doing long, slow driving.   Visibility out of the rear window is limited to begin with, and covered with winter grime it's practically nill.   That leaves me the option of rolling down a window and popping my head out or, you know, use the USS which isn't affected by dirt, same goes for the Radar that they also removed.     Another is coverage; for the front of the car, the camera has a similar or lesser view of the car, than a human driver, with a massive gap at the front of the car, and smaller ones at the front corners.   Sure, you can add more cameras but,    one: They cost money.   Two: Remember the part about DNNs not being great at the whole adapting/interpolating thing? Additonal, new angles and directions with new FoVs is not gonna fly with an extant network."

    "bady": "> Having a static, monoscopic camera system is just not close to being an analog for human vision and spatial awareness.  The brain can adapt to monocular vision, and you are allowed to drive even if you have only one working eye.  Temporal / parallax information is used by the brain to compensate, and a neural network can be structure and trained in the same way.  > An infinite problem space can not be approximated by the finite subspace of training instances  This isn't an infinite problem space as the complexities can be reduced and approximations are good enough.  It doesn't matter if the system models the tree as a lamp post and estimates it as being 50m away when it's 45m.  It only matters whether it correctly plans a route that doesn't involve driving into the tree.  > The cost of a set of USSs are not going to move the dial to any meaningful degree in a car costing 5 digits, especially the mid 5's. Even the cheapest cars on the market have them, they are cheap.  A full set of 8 sensors is going to add something in the order of £100 to the sticker price of a car.  That's enough for it to be worthwhile removing **if the replacement system is at least as good**.  Tesla aren't there yet, but that doesn't invalidate the end target they're striving for.  > An example is low visibility, be it darkness, bright light, weather or debris. Something as simple as dirt; Last winter my reverse camera was constantly caked in salt and road dirt from slush, same with the side cams when doing long, slow driving.  All of which can affect USS too.  I had to get out and wipe a cobweb off a sensor the other day as it was triggering it whenever the spider ran out onto the web.  USS can struggle in heavy rain and snow.  They can struggle with small objects, or objects at certain angles.    > Another is coverage; for the front of the car, the camera has a similar or lesser view of the car, than a human driver, with a massive gap at the front of the car, and smaller ones at the front corners.

They may not be road legal so you can get in trouble if you are found in one of these by a cop on the open road but more often than not cops don't want to get involved with this.  Most people hate them as they are slow, dangerous and dont have insurance, if you get hit by one of this you are fucked.

This works very similar to many ICE cars.  Other ICE cars have a manual pull cable.  In all cars, this is on the rear wheels only.  ICE cars do have an advantage in parking on a hill.  There are two systems in play to keep the car from moving.  The parking brake AND the transmission/engine.  Tesla ONLY has the parking brake.  As to how the parking brake gets engaged, there is no difference.  It doesn't matter if you press the park button, just leave the car and have it automatically go into park, or press and hold the button.  The parking brake is engaged in all the cases.  If you press and hold, you get the brake light.  But, it's all the same.  Now, this is different than when you are sitting at a light and the car is in hold.  In this case, the hydraulic braking system is engaged.  This has the advantage in that all four wheels brakes are engaged.  Unfortunately, the car can't sustain this while it is off. So, we have to settle for just the parking brake."

Instead, I would look at total cost of ownership over the expected period where you will own it. This includes fuel (or electricity), maintenance, insurance, and expected depreciation.  In reality, with an electric car maintenance costs are much much lower as are fuel costs. In addition, resell value on Teslas has stayed high, but only time can tell for that.

I remember working on a vehicle finder tool and dealers wanted us to send people to their dealerships even if they didn’t have the actual build someone was looking for.   Meaning they’d rather you show up under the false belief that they have what you want, then try to convince you to get something else than just sending you somewhere that already has exactly what you want."

    "bady": "Just got my adapter delivered today and took it into the village to test it out. I was already charged at home to 80% so I was only pulling about 20kW but I just wanted to make sure it worked and everything. It's a hefty boi. Definitely attach it to the cable first, then plug into the car.   It was a little clunky figuring out the process of locking/unlocking the charge port and starting the charge on the charger, etc. but it all worked out. I kept getting interrupted by people asking the typical EV questions about how much it costs to charge, how far it goes, etc etc while I was trying to figure it out, plus there's flowers or something nearby so honeybees kept flying in and out of the car through the open door and rear hatch. All in all it was a hectic experience but that's not the adapter's fault.   I still plan on primarily using the Supercharger network for long distance trips, but NY has been aggressive about putting in CCS stations at all the rest stops across the state, and more are popping up every day at gas stations and Walmart. Looking forward to more flexibility to travel further from the Supercharger network than I normally would.  Edit: I did also test this adapter with a J1772 plug on a Level 2 charger and it did not work. I was hoping that this adapter could serve as one consolidated piece for the two different plugs but unfortunately it does not. The plug will physically fit obviously but I just got errors on screen in the car about external charging equipment not providing power."
